# Crop Predictor &middot; [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)

* **Description** - It is a web application which will predict and recommend the suitable and appropriate crop for a land which depend upon on data of different soil PH levels, temperature and climatic condition of different cities. In the output section, the model will indicate the most appropriate crop for the land, with the ultimate goal of maximizing cultivation and profitability.

## Steps Involved
* The web application is purely based on python and python webframe called [**Flask**](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/).

* **First Step** - Firstly, the notebooks are created with the dataset and different algorithms models are developed using python libraries.
* **Second Step** - Then pickle files are created by the use of [Pickle library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) of python and the pickle files contain boolean details of the trained models.
* **Last Step** - The web application is developed with the help of [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) framework of python with the use of random forest alogorithm.

## How to install and run the project

* Add project to your local dekstop using ```git clone https://github.com/Priyanshu-21/Crop-Predictor.git```
* Now, change the directory of your terminal to ```cd app```
* Run command ```python app.py``` to run the app.py file in app folder.

## How to use the project

* This app provides information regarding the suitable land for particular types of farming. For example, if any farmer wants to do a farming of potato, so the application will display that where the good quality land according to climate, availability of soil which is available for farming.

* **Disclaimer** - This project is purely used for educational purpose any practical use of it will not be recommended.
